## Project description

Context: Our project addresses the challenge of precise maternal risk prediction using data from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices in the field of maternal health. The integration of these devices into healthcare settings has generated significant data, prompting the need to identify an optimal subset of IoMT devices for accurate risk prediction. This initiative aligns with the larger goal of improving healthcare technology for enhanced maternal health monitoring.

Problem: Maternal health is critical, necessitating early risk identification. To streamline risk prediction, the project tackles the challenge of selecting relevant sensors from the MaternalHealthRisk_project1.csv dataset, sourced from IoMT devices. The project intends to use feature selection to identify a concise set of devices that balance computational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and simplified device design.

Approach: Our approach involves meticulously exploring the IoMT-derived dataset and using feature selection to identify critical devices for maternal risk prediction. Machine learning models for classification and prediction are then implemented, with subsequent evaluation revealing the impact of selected features on predictive accuracy. These findings contribute to improved maternal health monitoring and have implications for future IoMT device design.

Impact: In addition to accurate risk prediction, our approach has the potential to reduce costs and simplify design for future maternal health monitoring systems. The project optimizes healthcare resources while also contributing to the ethical handling of sensitive maternal health data by strategically selecting IoMT devices. The simplified approach influences the design of IoMT devices, improving the quality of care for expectant mothers.

### Objective:

The goal is to use the Maternal Health Risk dataset, sourced from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, to improve the accuracy of maternal risk prediction. The challenge is to choose a subset of IoMT devices that minimizes costs and simplifies device design while maintaining near-identical accuracy in predicting maternal risk levels. The project aims to identify the most relevant sensors using feature selection techniques and machine learning models, contributing to the optimization of maternal health monitoring and influencing the future design and manufacturing of IoMT devices.
